Voxblox is a volumetric mapping library based mainly on Truncated Signed Distance Fields (TSDFs). It varies from other SDF libraries in the following ways:
 * CPU-only, can be run single-threaded or multi-threaded for some integrators
 * Support for multiple different layer types (containing different types of voxels)
 * Serialization using protobufs
 * Different ways of handling weighting during merging
 * Different ways of inserting pose information about scans
 * Tight ROS integration (in voxblox_ros package)
 * Easily extensible with whatever integrators you want
 * Features an implementation of building Euclidean Signed Distance Fields (ESDFs, EDTs) directly from TSDFs.

**If you're looking for skeletonization/sparse topology or planning applications, please refer to the [mav_voxblox_planning](https://github.com/ethz-asl/mav_voxblox_planning) repo.**
**If you want to create ground truth maps from meshes or gazebo environments, please check out the [voxblox_ground_truth](https://github.com/ethz-asl/voxblox_ground_truth) pakage!**
